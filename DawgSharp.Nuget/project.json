  "description": "DAWG (Directed Acyclic Word Graph) is a data structure for storing and searching large word lists while keeping your memory footprint small and lookups fast. DawgSharp is an open-source C# implementation featuring a linear time graph reduction algorithm and out-of-the-box persistence support.\nThe two main objects in the library are Dawg and DawgBuilder. Dawg is immutable, you must use DawgBuilder to build a Dawg and then save it to a stream. Then use Dawg.Load to rehydrate the data. Once reloaded, Dawg re-emerges as a completely different data structure (but, oddly, the same class) that is nearly as fast as a HashSet for lookups and is much, much more memory-efficient (factors of 30x - 40x are not uncommon). Please note that the Save/Load step is necessary to get the full potential out of the Dawg object. Use a MemoryStream if disk interaction is not desired.\nThe Dawg class can be thought of as a read-only Dictionary <string, Value> type. It has the [\"string\"] indexer and implements IEnumerable <KeyValuePair <string, Value>>.\nOne other very useful feature of Dawg (not found in Dictionary) is the ability to quickly find all words that start with a particular substring: dawg.MatchPrefix (\"star\") could possibly yield \"star\", \"starch\", \"start\", \"starting\", etc.\nThis package is provided under the terms of the GNU GPL v3.
